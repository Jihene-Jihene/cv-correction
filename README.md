Inconsistent Date Formats:

Issue: The dates are not consistently formatted (e.g., “March 2022 to August 2025” vs. “Oct 2021 to Dec 2021”).

Fix: Use a consistent date format throughout the resume. For example, “March 2022 - August 2025” and “October 2021 - December 2021”.

Unclear Job Descriptions:

Issue: Some job descriptions are vague and lack specific achievements (e.g., “Boosted team efficiency by a high rate”).

Fix: Provide specific metrics and clearer descriptions. For example, “Increased team efficiency by 30% by implementing agile methodologies and streamlining communication processes.”

Redundant Information:

Issue: Repetition of information, such as mentioning the company name twice in the work experience section.

Fix: Consolidate information to avoid redundancy. For example, “Junior Software Engineer, Heiman Software Labs (March 2022 - August 2025)” and “Intern, Heiman Software Labs (October 2021 - December 2021)”.

Lack of Contact Information Formatting:

Issue: The contact information is not well-formatted and lacks consistency.

Fix: Format the contact information clearly and consistently. For example:
Keith Shannons
Software Engineer
Email: hello@reallygreatsite.com
Phone: +123-456-7890
LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/KeithShannons
Website: www.reallygreatsite.com

Missing Section Headers:

Issue: Some sections are not clearly labeled, making it hard to navigate the resume.

Fix: Add clear section headers. For example:
WORK EXPERIENCE
Junior Software Engineer, Heiman Software Labs (March 2022 - August 2025)
Intern, Heiman Software Labs (October 2021 - December 2021)
